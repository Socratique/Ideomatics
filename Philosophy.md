# Philosophy of Ideomatics

roughly what the philosophical/ideological form and perspectives of Ideomatics are.


### As Metaphysics

Ideas as objects/behaviors, full scope of reality is constructable through MIK(all things will have properties an idea can represent.)
-Ideons, Ideonic Fields, Ideonome.

alternative perspective, MIK or some structure like it, is the true metaphysical base of reality. Fields of raw concept that intersect to form 'Things'

### As Epistemology

Ideas are what we know the world through. Ideas practically represent reality(Empiricism/reality). All experience is an Idea.

### As Ethics

Ideomatics includes some structure of Good/Bad/Value as fundamental to MIK and as some base structure in reality.

### As Aesthetics

same as Ethics, but Beauty/Ugliness??
