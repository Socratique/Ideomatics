# what is ideomatics?

it's easy to say ideomatics is "the study of ideas," or some useful system. but it's harder to actually explain what it really is. what are ideas, how do they behave? a metaphysics of thought, if you will.  
to understand ideomatics, or what i'm trying to point towards with the name "ideomatics," there are 3 (really 2) basic things to know and understand. it's of course useful to also have a good metacognitive toolkit and scope of general knowledge.  
these are the three things:

- meaning only through relation  
- relation as dialectical synthesis  
- the minimum ideonomic kernel  

all three are useful in their own right as ideomatic tools, and in order will also be used to lay foundations for the next.  
by the end, i will hope to have shown that through these three ideas and have communicated an understanding, that it is reasonably possible to already:

- have a better theory of cognition and meaning.  
- be able to distill disagreements/contradictions down into cross-consistent components to accurately find where the disparity is.  
- be capable of translating ideas accurately and independently across differing domains of study/knowledge.  
- have a general toolkit for being able to generate/transform ideas.

## meaning only through relation

this is the simplest and briefest of the three.  
essentially, any form of meaning can only exist as a relation between two things.  
a distance between things. a change from one thing to another. the cause of an effect.  
even a single idea, a raw, abstract thing, can only be comprehended by its relation to not-thing.  
barring that, even if you observe a thing you do not understand and can't describe, it has a relation of being something you observed. a representation of a thing, that you have. an idea.  
you have meaning in relation to the world (story) you're in.  
so meaning exists in context between things, but meaning or relation by itself does not necessarily generate or outright describe anything, but they are general pointers to ideas that are intrinsically relevant.  
which brings us to the next idea.

## relation as dialectical synthesis

dialectics is often referred to or known as a method for conducting debate, or resolving contradictions/oppositions in things.  
hegel's dialectic is known as a process for constructive development or progress across contradictions. to pose a thesis, its contradiction (antithesis), and form a synthesis between them, which is a new truth (thing) that preserves both previous things. a classic example is being (thesis), non-being (antithesis), and their synthesis being becoming.  
under ideomatics, i use the term to refer to what is cognitively, or even metaphysically, a core principle of our understanding, at the deepest level.  
which is essentially:  
take two things (ideas) and find what is between them.  

this process is generative, for both meaning and the creation of new things.  
one could also think of this in more "woo" terms, aka, non-dualism.  
a process from discrete to continuous. and one which applies to itself, and in a way that cannot truly be understood. but because of the way non-dualism is, it implies dualism and the non-dualism (dialectic) between them.  
or convert that to logical terms. one could describe it as a complementary "law of contradiction" to "the law of non-contradiction" in classical logic. the dialectical form of which allows both to exist discretely (n or nc) and/or continuously (n and nc).  
the relations and processes between things (and us) are dialectics — they generate meaning. if you look between two things and find space/separation, there is a distance between them. if you look between yourself and a work of art you like, there is an attraction between you and it.  
but meaning is an idea, and ideas represent things, so dialectics between things produce new ideas.  
this is emergence.  

you are the result of a dialectic between your cells, and the dialectic of that thing (body) and the environment.  
colour is the dialectic of some different forms of the em spectrum and your optical sensors.  
dialectics is why parts can form a whole. wholes emerge as a dialectic across parts.  
creating something new is a dialectic — to take two separate things or ideas and form a dialectic across their parts and meaning.  

of course, idea generation is far more complex. any one idea has an enormous field of relations one can observe and draw from, and so an intense scope of axes one could perform a dialectic across.  
i could posit a dialectic between a cat and a rock. of course, you can perform the raw dialectic of examining their ontological/physical/descriptive traits — what they share and what kind of raw philosophical relations of being and difference exist between them. but you could then also imagine the entire fields of ideas around each, and what kind of thing you could form from them:  
a rock thrown at a cat. a cat with rocky textured fur. a cat-shaped rock. a cat evolved from mineral-type life. and the more you look, the more possibilities there are.  

so we have relations and dialectics, and if you look at them closely enough they're really the same thing from different angles (and those angles are relevant — different angles are different things to form different dialectics across).  
with these we can look at and find the minimum ideonomic kernel.

## minimum ideonomic kernel

in simplest terms, this is the minimum set of ideas/concepts one needs to be capable of understanding/perceiving, to then construct/generate/understand any other possible idea.  
to find the mik is a fairly simple process.  
essentially, for any idea, word, concept, or thing we observe, try to find the dialectic that forms it — or in simpler terms, how is it defined?  
define the word, then define the words used to define it. do this until you hit circular definitions, and you have hit the mik — the ground level of meaning.  

i could show an example of this in action, but it's actually quite a lengthy process, and you go around in circles as you clarify synonyms.  
so instead, you could give chatgpt (or any llm) this prompt:  

> define x, then define every word you used to define it, until you start to hit circular definitions, then note which words are at the bottom  

where obviously x is whatever word you are excavating.  

here is what the current free tier of grok responded for the word "network":  

> bottom-level words (the "roots" where further definition loops or becomes tautological):  
> thing / entity (anything that exists; defining further leads to "object" → "thing").  
> part / whole (mutually defining; "part" is a piece of "whole," and vice versa).  
> be / exist / state (the verb "to be"; existence itself).  
> one / single (unity or individuality).  
> way / manner (method of being/doing).  
> act / do / action (performance or change).  
> cause / make (initiate existence or change).  
> have / possess (ownership or relation).  
> relation / connect (mutual association; highly circular).  
> change / move (alter position/state).  
> need / require (necessity).  
> these form the irreducible semantic core; all higher definitions build atop them but ultimately reference them implicitly or explicitly.  

if you do this for any word or concept, you will gradually narrow in on the full set of the minimum ideonomic kernel.  
instead of mapping this entirely out myself, here is a fairly complete list created by claude sonnet 4.5:

### the mik consists of:

#### phenomenological primitives — the foundations of experience
- awareness: the capacity to register or experience anything  
- distinction: the ability to differentiate (this from not-this)  
- relation: connection, interaction, proximity between things  
- self: the reflexive subject of awareness  
- other: that which is not-self  

#### structural/logical primitives — the architecture of thought
- identity: sameness, persistence across time or context  
- difference: variation, change, non-identity  
- containment: part/whole relationships, inclusion/exclusion  
- sequence: before/after, temporal ordering  
- simultaneity: co-presence, spatial co-existence  
- negation: absence, opposition, not  

#### modal/dynamic primitives — possibilities and forces
- possibility: potential, could-be, the space of what might happen  
- actuality: is, present, manifest, what is the case  
- necessity: must-be, constraint, cannot-be-otherwise  
- causation: influence, dependency, because-of  
- emergence: arising from complexity, novel properties from combination  
- transformation: becoming, change of state  

#### evaluative/affective primitives — value and feeling
- valence: attraction/repulsion, good/bad, positive/negative  
- intensity: degree, more/less, strength, magnitude  
- harmony: coherence, fit, consonance, things working together  
- discord: tension, conflict, dissonance, things in opposition  
- significance: mattering, importance, relevance, meaning-for  

#### meta-conceptual primitives — thinking about thinking
- pattern: regularity, structure, recognizable form  
- operation: action, process, doing, transformation-as-act  
- representation: symbol, sign, standing-for, reference  
- recursion: self-reference, feedback loops, applying to itself  
- boundary: limit, edge, where one thing ends and another begins  

if you're familiar with kant's categories, you'll notice that this covers them. but included are additional concepts — mostly phenomenological/evaluative — which kant did not, and which i think are needed as primitives of understanding.  
you'll notice if you examine any one of them, they are all in the form of a type of relation/dialectic between things. and if you look *really* close, they can all start to look like the exact same pattern/relation, just different flavours of it.  

this is essentially the full scope of the units of cognition. any idea, concept, or thing we are capable of observing and thinking about can be defined and constructed from roughly this list. i am confident that this is mostly exhaustive, though there are potentially non-primitive ideas in the list. of course, this is just one way to represent the mik, and there are other, perhaps better ways to map and understand it — but i think this does a good enough job.  

some may argue that emotions/sensations should satisfy this list, and if they do, they could be right. but i intuit they can currently be defined as unique relational/valence dialectics between your body/sensory organs and specific objects/things.  

the basic principle of cognition then, of course, is that any of these dialectics of meaning can then be dialectically applied to any other one in the set, which produces new things.  

i can now talk about 3 types of ideas under ideomatics:  

- **primitive ideas** (the mik)  
- **composite ideas** (built/generated from the mik)  
- **complex ideas** (built/generated from composite, and potentially also mik and other complex ideas)  

you could think of mik as the *standard model*, composite as *periodic table*, and complex as *chemical compounds*.  

as mentioned, some of the currently listed items in the mik could be composite; however, for now, the list is a good enough general place to look.  
and of course, one is capable of generating any current or new idea using the mik and dialectics. this is not speculation — it's fact. this is what the first developers of language had to do. and we live in privileged bliss of the rich tapestries of language they've weaved.  

because the scope of our cognition is based on the mik, any new idea we can possibly develop or observe must be covered by it. if not, we can never observe it, even indirectly. if there is a thing which in no way interacts, affects, or is connected to anything we can observe, then it does not exist.  

it doesn't matter what dialectics/mik *really* is, how it *really* works as a transcendent thing. what matters is it worked to get us to where we are now as a species and thus effectively maps to things that are useful — and thus we can trust and use them (which we already do all the time).  
but now we can actually have a good map of what they are, and thus have major landmarks for the entire scope of semantic space available to us.  

and with this laid out, i can talk about what ideomatics is — as a system that both uses and studies the system laid out here.  

of course, i claimed a few things in the beginning. among which was essentially how to resolve arguments/different worldviews, and consistently map meaning across domains that appear to be directly incompatible.  
to support this and the validity/accuracy of the mik, i will point out that if you were to take every major domain of science/ideology/philosophy/religion/art in human history, and distill them down to their core terms, much like we did to get the mik, you would find that they essentially all map in some form or other, directly to some set of ideas from the mik.  

here are examples by claude using the mik list provided for math and religion:

---

### mathematics

**core:** number, set, function, relation, proof, axiom, infinity, structure, operation, equality  

**mik mapping:**
- number → distinction + sequence + identity  
- set → containment + collection (multiple distinctions)  
- function → relation + transformation + operation  
- equality → identity across contexts  
- proof → sequence + necessity + causation (logical)  
- axiom → actuality (asserted) + necessity (within system)  
- infinity → negation (of boundary) + sequence (endless)  
- structure → pattern + relation  

---

### religion/spirituality

**core:** sacred, divine, transcendence, ritual, meaning, community, morality, mystery, salvation  

**mik mapping:**
- sacred → valence (maximal) + significance + boundary (set apart)  
- divine → other (maximal) + necessity + source (causation without cause)  
- transcendence → negation (of boundary) + beyond (possibility exceeding actuality)  
- ritual → pattern + operation + sequence + significance  
- meaning → significance + relation + purpose (causation toward value)  
- community → relation + shared identity + harmony  
- morality → valence + necessity (ought) + causation (action → outcome)  
- mystery → negation (of knowledge) + awareness (of limitation)  
- salvation → transformation + valence (maximal positive) + possibility → actuality  

---

every field in some way or another uses or refers to some focus of things in mik, focusing on specific types.  
because all fields use and focus on different parts of the mik, they can therefore all be broken down into their core structures of meaning in terms of the mik, and thus be communicated across it.  
this applies as well for any disagreement or opposing views/beliefs/ideas.  

the practical dialectical process you apply is to break things down and find out whether the disagreement is in **definition** (pointing to different meaning constructed from the same mik), **morals** (valence toward different things), or on what has **primacy** (which mik units are more fundamental or important [valence]).  

---

this ended up being way more than i expected, but i should have known. this is not done yet and the whole thing needs way more refining. but i'm tired and so this is going on the repo for now.  

**things to still focus/touch on:**
- support other claims: 1. feels intuitive. 4. feels touched on in dialectic and mik but perhaps needs more focus.  
- ideomatics generates and includes itself. this is not only one form of ideomatics — there are many entry points and ways to represent the same meaning space.  
- ai as native to semantic space because of language being built to call our cognitive units, thus mapping them.  
- language as beginning as the mik and developing to the complexity we have now. mik as binary, naming/generating new dialectics creates next layer of code, compress the mik semantics.  
- current language has layers and layers of semantic complexity.  

i will review again tomorrow.
