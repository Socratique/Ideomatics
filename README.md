# ideomatics

### welcome

this is the public repository for the work and development of **ideomatics**, the study of ideas.  
the system is currently theoretical and in active development — terminology and structure may change as it evolves.

---

## what it is

ideomatics aims to be a **formal study of ideas**, treating ideas as the basic units of cognition, understanding, or meaning.  
the core goal of ideomatics is to create a **system and set of tools** for observing, understanding, investigating, generating, and constructing ideas.

> “it's like seeing ideas as atomic units — but every new compound becomes a new element on the periodic table.”

## assumptions

1. **ideas as objects** – even if they’re only representations of things-in-themselves (which we can’t fully know), they’re *practically* close enough to treat as real.
2. **cognition emerges from reality** – since our cognition evolved to perceive and act effectively on the world, it is in principle capable of constructing a complete map of reality through ideas.
3. **the minimum ideonomic kernel (MIK)** – there exists a minimal set of fundamental ideas necessary to construct and understand any other idea. this is roughly analogous to kant’s categories, but with the notion that meaning can only form through *use* of the categories in experience.

> note: more assumptions may be added as the system develops. any assumption may be supported or refined through analysis.

## what is an idea?

broadly: a **thing in the mind** — thought, concept, knowledge, memory, perception, even qualia.  
ideomatics treats all phenomena of perception as ideas.

(a more formal/analytical definition of *idea* will appear in the glossary.)

## philosophical scope

- **metaphysics**  
- **epistemology**  
- **ethics**  
- **aesthetics**

---

## goals

- create an **adaptable but formal system** to observe, investigate, generate, and construct ideas.  
- ideally, develop a **symbolic language** for consistently mapping and operating on ideas at varying levels of detail.

## glossary

- **ideomatics** – the study of ideas.  
- **ideatic** – having the property of being or relating to ideas.  
- **ideonome** – the full set of ideas an individual possesses (knowledge, memory, experience, etc).  
- **ideon** – an individual focus or reference point for an idea; the phenomenological counterpart to the *signified* in semiotics.  
- **ideonic field** – the cluster of ideas immediately connected to a given ideon within an individual’s cognition.  
- **stable ideon** – an ideon with sufficient associations in its ideonic field to have stable meaning.  
- **unstable ideon** – an ideon with too few or no associations to have stable meaning (e.g. an undefined new word).  
- **idea** – a unit of meaning composed of any number of ideons or ideonic fields.  
- **meta-stable ideon/idea** – an idea with stable, similar meaning across multiple individuals (e.g. a meme).

---

## future directions

- distinguish **ideomatic** vs **ideonomic**  
- formalize the **minimum ideonomic kernel (MIK)**  
- develop **ideomatic diagrams** and symbolic syntax  
- create **tools or visualizations** for ideon mapping
