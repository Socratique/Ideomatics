# Ideomatics

## Welcome
This is the public repository for the work and development of Ideomatics, The study of Ideas.  
This is currently a theoretical and in development system and may change over time as it is developed.  
Terms and language may change.

## What it is
Ideomatics aims to broadly be a study of ideas, where ideas are considered basic units of cognition, understanding or meaning.
It is Theory of Imagination, World Building, Model Construction, Divination from Potential(Ideomancy - subfield). Theory of Learning, Thinking, Theory Itself.

The Core Goal of Ideomatics is to create a system and tools for better observing, understanding, investigating, generating and constructing Ideas.

## Ideomatics makes some basic assumptions
1. Ideas as objects and units of our cognition, even if they are only representations of things-in-themselves we can't really know, are sufficiently practical to be considered 'close enough' as things in themselves.  
2. That our Cognition having emerged from reality and practical enough to observe and act on reality, is theoretically capable of eventually(even if only through grandly complex ideas) mapping/understanding every part of reality. IE there is a full set of all possible ideas we are capable of constructing into which reality can allow to exist if conditions are sufficient.  
3. That there is a minimum set of Ideas that one must observe/learn necessary to be capable of constructing and understanding any other idea.(See Minimum Ideonomic Kernal). Similar to/including Kant's Catagories, but with the roughly notion that meaning can only form through use of the catagories in experience.
4. All, if not most, humans share a universal framework of meaning(idea space). and new discoveries in this space of meaning(generations/transformations) can be communicated, else all of humanity would not be as coherent.

Note: more may be added if realized. Any assumptions can be supported

## What is an idea?
Broadly refers to being an Thing in your mind. One could also say thought, concept, knowledge, memory.  
Ideomatics treats everything in perception as generally an idea, including what many may refer to as Qualia. or Ideas are Qualia.

There will be a more formal/analytical term for idea in the glossary

## What it aims to do
- create an adaptable but useful system to observe, investigate, generate and construct ideas.  
- ideal form of this is a symbolic language that allows for cross consistent mapping and operation on ideas at high and low detail

- otherwise concern is with mapping most common ideas and finding useful ideomatic tools
