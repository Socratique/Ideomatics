# Ideomatics

## Welcome
This is the public repository for the work and development of Ideomatics, The study of Ideas.  
This is currently a theoretical and in development system and may change over time as it is developed.  
Terms and language may change.

## What it is
Ideomatics aims to broadly be a study of ideas, where ideas are considered basic units of cognition, understanding or meaning.  
The Core Goal of Ideomatics is to create and system and tools for better observing, understanding, investigating, generating and constructing Ideas.

One way I could describe Ideomatics, is it's like seeing ideas as atomic units, but every new compound is just an additional element on the periodic table.

## Ideomatics makes some basic assumptions
1. Ideas as objects and units of our cognition, even if they are only representations of things-in-themselves we can't really know, are sufficiently practical to be considered 'close enough' as things in themselves.  
2. That our Cognition having emerged from reality and practical enough to observe and act on reality, is theoretically capable of eventually(even if only through grandly complex ideas) mapping/understanding every part of reality. IE there is a full set of all possible ideas we are capable of constructing into which reality can allow to exist if conditions are sufficient.  
3. That there is a minimum set of Ideas that one must observe/learn necessary to be capable of constructing and understanding any other idea.(See Minimum Ideonomic Kernal). Similar to/including Kant's Catagories, but with the roughly notion that meaning can only form through use of the catagories in experience.

Note: more may be added if realized. Any assumptions can be supported

## What is an idea?
Broadly refers to being an Thing in your mind. One could also say thought, concept, knowledge, memory.  
Ideomatics treats everything in perception as generally an idea, including what many may refer to as Qualia.

There will be a more formal/analytical term for idea in the glossary

## What it aims to do
- create an adaptable but useful system to observe, investigate, generate and construct ideas.  
- ideal form of this is a symbolic language that allows for cross consistent mapping and operation on ideas at high and low detail

## Glossary
- **Ideomatics** – The study of Ideas  
- **Ideatic** – having the property of being an idea/related to ideas  
- **Ideonome** – The full set of every idea an individual has, including all knowledge/memory/experience.  
- **Ideon** – an individual focus/entry point/reference to a n idea. Can be considered the phenomenological counterpart to the Signified in Semiotics.  
- **Ideonic Field** – the ideas most immediately connected/associated with the Ideon in an individual  
- **Stable Ideon** – An Ideon with sufficient mass in its Ideonic field that is has stable meaning. Relatedly an Unstable Ideon is one which has no or too few connections/associations with other ideas to have meaning. eg. A new word you have been shown no image of or had defined, or something someone has tried to communicate to you  
- **Idea** – a unit of meaning containing any number of ideas/ideons/ideonomic fields.  
- **Meta-Stable Ideon/Idea** – an idea for which there is a stable ideon in similar enough forms across multiple individuals to have the same meaning. Could include a meme.
